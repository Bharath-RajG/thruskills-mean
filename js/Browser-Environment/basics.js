// BOM and DOM Overview

// The JavaScript code in a page has access to a number of objects. These objects can be divided into the following types

//Core ECMAScript objects: This consists of all the objects mentioned in the previous sessions.

//DOM: This consists of objects that have to do with the currently loaded page, which is also called the document.

// BOM: This consists of objects that deal with everything outside the page - the browser window and the desktop screen.
