// A normal function in order to try to convert any value to a number. This is similar to the use of parseInt() or parseFloat()

// A constructor function (with new) to create objects.

var n = Number('12.2');

var objNumber = new Number('13.23');

console.log(typeof n);

console.log(typeof objNumber);



// As functions are objects, they can also have properties. The Number() function has constant built- in properties that you cannot modify

console.log(Number.MAX_VALUE);

console.log(Number.MIN_VALUE);

console.log(Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY);

console.log(Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY);
